          downDATA (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) lets you track the status of services like GitHub, Supabase, Cloudflare, and other Atlassian
          Statuspage-based providers, group them into boards, and get incident history and Slack notifications. This policy explains what information we
          collect when you use downDATA, why, and what choices you have about it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-3 text-xl font-bold">1. Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Account information.</strong> When you sign up with email/password or Google, we (via our authentication provider, Supabase) store your
          email address and an encrypted password or your Google account identifier.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          <strong>Tracked services, boards, and integrations.</strong> Which services you choose to track, how you group them into boards, and any Slack
          workspace you connect via &ldquo;Add to Slack&rdquo; are stored so we can show your dashboard and, if you&rsquo;ve connected Slack, post status
          notifications to the channel you picked.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          <strong>Incident history.</strong> For tracked services, we keep a durable history of status changes and incidents (polled periodically from each
          provider&rsquo;s public Statuspage feed) so past incidents remain visible even after they&rsquo;re resolved. This is public status data about the
          services you track, not personal data about you.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          <strong>Support conversations.</strong> If you opt in to live chat (see Cookies below) and message us, those conversations are handled by
          Tawk.to.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          <strong>Usage data.</strong> If you opt in to analytics (see Cookies below), we collect anonymized, aggregate usage data via Vercel Analytics and
          Speed Insights: page views and performance metrics, not the specifics of what you track.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-3 text-xl font-bold">2. How we use this information</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
          <li>To provide the service: your dashboard, tracked services, boards, and incident history.</li>
          <li>To operate your account: authentication and, where connected, your Slack integration.</li>
          <li>To send the Slack notifications you configured when a tracked service&rsquo;s status changes.</li>
          <li>To protect the service from abuse.</li>
          <li>With your consent, to understand aggregate usage and improve the product, and to provide live chat support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3">We do not sell your personal information, ever.</p>

        <h2 id="cookies" className="mt-8 mb-3 text-xl font-bold">
          3. Cookies
        </h2>
        <p>
          We use three categories of cookies/local storage, matching the choices in the &ldquo;Cookie preferences&rdquo; link in the footer of this site:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Necessary</strong>: keeps you logged in and protects login forms from bots. Always on: the site can&rsquo;t function without these, and
            GDPR/ePrivacy don&rsquo;t require consent for strictly necessary technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics</strong>: Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights. Off by default; only loads once you opt in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support chat</strong>: the Tawk.to live chat widget. Off by default; only loads once you opt in.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3">
          You can change your choice at any time using the &ldquo;Cookie preferences&rdquo; link in the footer of any page. Your decision is stored in your
          browser&rsquo;s local storage, not a tracking cookie.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-3 text-xl font-bold">4. Third-party services we use</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Supabase</strong>: authentication and database hosting for your account, tracked services, boards, and incident history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vercel</strong>: hosting, and (opt-in only) analytics and performance monitoring.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Slack</strong>: optional notification integration, only if you connect a workspace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tawk.to</strong>: live chat support (opt-in only).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Each tracked service&rsquo;s own status provider</strong>: live status shown on downDATA is fetched directly from that service&rsquo;s
            public Statuspage API, on demand; we don&rsquo;t store it beyond the incident history described above.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3">Each of these providers processes data under their own privacy policy, only for the purposes described above.</p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-3 text-xl font-bold">5. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your account, tracked services, boards, and Slack connection for as long as your account exists. Incident history is kept for the
          services being tracked and isn&rsquo;t tied to any individual account.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-3 text-xl font-bold">6. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have the right to access, correct, export, or delete your personal information. downDATA doesn&rsquo;t yet
          have a self-service account page for this. Contact us at{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`} className="link">
            {SUPPORT_EMAIL}
          </a>{" "}
          and we&rsquo;ll act on your request.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-8 mb-3 text-xl font-bold">7. Children&rsquo;s privacy</h2>
        <p>This service is not directed at children under 16, and we don&rsquo;t knowingly collect information from them.</p>
